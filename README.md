# Bunny-Defender
Save the bunny from falling Rocks!!!

In this game, you will need Phaser Framework(Don't worry I have included all the necessary files!!) 
(I am planning to create an app of this so that you don't need to set up any live server) 

# Steps to Run the game:
1. Clone the project.
2. Follow the index.html<br>
3.start the Live server(I used Vscode Live server)<br>
4.Enjoy!!
